# ice_doubly_linked_list
ICE doubly linked list is a Open Source C library to help in two-way linked lists creation and work(insert,delete, traversal each element, destroy).

You can use this small library to solve memory problems...

In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.(by wikipedia) 

First step, understand before run

Study the src/main.c to understand how to use...
Study calls to know how to use  lib...  lib/ice\_doubly\_linked.h

any doubts... create issue or send me a e-mail...
